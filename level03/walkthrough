this program compares two strings, if the comparison is true it will call /bin/sh
The first string goes throguh a decryption function that will xor each of its characters X number of times, where X is 322424845 - our input number
however, unless the result of the substraction is between 1 and 21, it will use a rand generated number instead
After inspecting the encrypted string we can see that it is a rot 18 of the second string
this means we will simply have to enter a number that will result as 18 after substracting it to 322424845
